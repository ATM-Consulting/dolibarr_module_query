I. PDF generation
   
   1. To transform and send dashboard by mail you'll need WKHTMLTOPDF. 
   		a. Use the lib/wkhtmltox-0.12.2.1_linux-wheezy-amd64.deb or retrieve the good one from http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
   		b. in terminal, install it as root with "dpkg -i wkhtmltox-0.12.2.1_linux-wheezy-amd64.deb" and "apt-get install -f"
   		c. don't use wkhtmltopdf from repository of debian, it can't run headless (because of a bug)
   		d. configure your cron to call the mail-dashboard.php from commande line with argument 1 (DAY,WEEK,MONTH) and argument 2 (step 1 or 2)
   		
   		
   	2. To export list as custom list with ODT or ODS template you'll need libreoffice
   		a. in terminal, install it as root with "apt-get install libreoffice-writer". It's normally sufficient
